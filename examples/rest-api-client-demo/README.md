## Usage

### Set environment variables

### Modify hard-coded IDs

Currently, we have hard-coded IDs in files that are in `src/` like `app.ts`, `bulkRequest.ts`, `file.ts`, and `record.ts`.
We are going to fix the problem, but currently, you have to modify the IDs your self.

We have an app ID in `customize-manifest.json`, so you have to update the app ID if you deploy a script to your Kintone environment.

### Run a script with `ts-node`

```
% yarn run-script record getRecord
```

### Upload scripts to your Kintone environment

```
% yarn deploy
```
